# Oystercard Challenge

This week's challenge will start with going back over the basics we covered last week in Boris Bikes, giving you the chance to reinforce what you learned last week. You'll then be challenged to build a more complex system which should really stretch your skills in Ruby, TDD and object-oriented design.

## Focus goals

Mindful engagement with these challenges can help you achieve these goals:

<dl>
  <dt>I write code that is easy to change</dt>
  <dd>Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.</dd>
  <dt>I can test-drive my code</dt>
  <dd>Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.</dd>
  <dt>I can build with objects</dt>
  <dd>Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.</dd>
